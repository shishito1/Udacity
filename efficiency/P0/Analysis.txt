# Worst Case Run Time Analysis

## Task 0
Runtime is O(1) to get the first record of texts and the last record of calls.

* Get first text record: O(1)
* Get last call record: O(1)
* Worst case: O(1)


## Task 1
Runtime is O(n) because it is O(n) for the first for loop and O(n) for the second for loop. Their sum is O(2n) but as n gets sufficiently large, the coefficient is insignificant.

* Get unique numbers in texts: O(n)
* Get unique numbers in calls: O(n)
* Worst case: O(n)


## Task 2
Iterating through the dictionary is the slowest runtime at O(n).

* Dictionary of duration sum: O(n)
* Longest duration: O(n)
* Worst case: O(n)


Task 3
The sorted() runtime of O(nlogn) is the worst case.

* Iteration: O(n)
* Sort: O(nlogn)
* get_mobile_area_code: O(n)
* get_fixed_area_code: O(n)
* Worst case: O(nlogn)


Task 4
The worst case run time is O(nlogn) for sorted().

* non_telemarketer set: O(n)
* outging calls set: O(n)
* telemarketers set: O(n)
* sorted: O(nlogn)
* Worst case: O(nlogn)
